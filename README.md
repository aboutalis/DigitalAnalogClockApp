# Digital&AnalogClockApp

The Digital&AnalogClockApp is a web application that implements a digital clock and an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to switch between the digital and analog clock display.

## Features

### Digital Clock
The digital clock component shows the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. It dynamically updates in real-time, ensuring accurate timekeeping. The hours, minutes, and seconds are displayed as separate elements on the clock face, with leading zeros added to single-digit values. Additionally, the current date is shown below the clock, providing users with both time and date information.

### Analog Clock
The analog clock component presents the time using traditional hour, minute, and second hands on a clock face. The clock face is designed with a classic appearance, featuring clear hour markings and minute indicators. The hour hand, minute hand, and second hand move smoothly and continuously, reflecting the current time. This analog representation of time offers a familiar and intuitive way for users to perceive the passage of time.

### Switch Button
To enhance user experience and provide flexibility, the project includes a switch button. This button allows users to toggle between the digital and analog clock display modes. By clicking the "Digital" button, users can switch to the digital clock view, where the time is presented numerically. Conversely, by clicking the "Analog" button, users can switch to the analog clock view, where the time is displayed using clock hands on a circular face. The switch button enables users to choose their preferred clock format according to their preference or needs.

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `indexDigital.html`: HTML file for the digital clock display.
- `indexAnalog.html`: HTML file for the analog clock display.
- `styleDigital.css`: CSS file for styling the digital clock.
- `styleAnalog.css`: CSS file for styling the analog clock.
- `scriptDigital.js`: JavaScript file for implementing the digital clock functionality.
- `scriptAnalog.js`: JavaScript file for implementing the analog clock functionality.
- `scriptYear.js`: JavaScript file for displaying the current year in the footer.
- `switchButton.js`: JavaScript file for handling the switch button functionality.

## Usage

To use the Digital&AnalogClockApp, simply open either the `indexDigital.html` or `indexAnalog.html` file in a web browser. The clock will start displaying the current time, and you can switch between the digital and analog clock display by clicking the respective buttons.

Overall, the Digital&AnalogClockApp combines the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and functional clock application. It offers users the convenience of both digital and analog representations of time, allowing them to choose their preferred display style. Whether users prefer the simplicity of digital numbers or the timeless charm of an analog clock, this app provides an engaging and user-friendly experience.
